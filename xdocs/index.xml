    <section name="Commons CLI2">
      <p>
        CLI2 has been developed with the goals of clearer responsibilities and
        being more flexible than Commons CLI.  The intention is that CLI2 should 
        be able to model a far greater selection of interfaces and do so more 
        completely, validating as much as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        The redesigned CLI2 is rooted in the <code>org.apache.commons.cli2</code>
        package.
      </p>

    <section name="Documentation">
      <p>
        A full <a href="introduction.html">User's Guide</a> is available
        as are various <a href="project-reports.html">project reports</a>.
      </p>
      <p>

      </ul>

    <section name="Releases">
      <p>
        CLI2 is a component in the Commons Sandbox and therefore has not had a release. 
      </p>
    </section>

    <section name="Support">
      <p>The <a href="mail-lists.html">commons mailing lists</a> act as the main support forum. The user list
      is suitable for most library usage queries. The dev list is intended for the development discussion. Please
      remember that the lists are shared between all commons components, so prefix your email subject by
      <code>[cli2]</code>.</p>

      <p>Issues may be reported via the <a href="issue-tracking.html">ASF JIRA</a>.</p>
